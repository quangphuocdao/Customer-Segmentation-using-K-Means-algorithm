Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. These groups can be based on various factors such as purchasing behavior, interests, demographics, and more. The purpose of segmentation is to enable more targeted marketing and service strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing company revenue.

This project provides a comprehensive Python implementation for customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the clustering results. It is designed to be easy to use and modify for different datasets and business requirements.
